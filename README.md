# Augmented Reality Navigation System for the Visually Impaired

## Overview

This project simulates an Augmented Reality (AR) Navigation System implemented in Java for the visually impaired. The system allows users to input their current location coordinates, and it identifies the nearest point of interest (POI) to provide auditory or haptic feedback for navigation.

## Features

- **Nearest POI Identification:** Identifies the nearest point of interest (POI) based on user's current location coordinates.
- **Basic Command-Line Interface:** Provides a simple command-line interface for user interaction.
- **Predefined Points of Interest:** Includes predefined points of interest with their names and locations for navigation.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/ar-navigation-system.git>
    
    ```
    
2. **Compile and Run:**
    
    ```bash
    cd ar-navigation-system
    javac ARNavigationSystem.java
    java ARNavigationSystem
    
    ```
    
3. **Enter Current Location:**
    
    Enter your current latitude and longitude coordinates when prompted.
    

## Usage

1. **Enter Current Location:**
    
    Input your current latitude and longitude coordinates to identify the nearest point of interest for navigation.
    
2. **View Nearest POI:**
    
    The system will display the nearest point of interest based on your current location coordinates.
